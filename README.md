# flight-fare-analysis
A multi year analysis of domestic airfare trends in India (2016–2024), comparing pricing patterns across major airlines, routes, and directions. Includes data cleaning, exploratory insights, and price evolution over time.

This repository explores how domestic flight fares in India have evolved between 2016 and 2024. The dataset covers key airline players (IndiGo, Air India, Vistara, SpiceJet, etc.) and major metro routes like Delhi–Mumbai, Bangalore–Hyderabad, and more.

The project includes:

Aggregated and cleaned airfare datasets

Airline wise and route wise price comparisons

Directional fare asymmetries (e.g., Delhi → Mumbai vs Mumbai → Delhi)

Yearly fare fluctuations and trends

Setup for future extensions: time series models, ML based fare predictors
